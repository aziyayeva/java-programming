/**
 * Coding task to practice with:
 * [Merge Strings]
 * User is given two Strings, which could vary in length, merge these Strings so these Strings are
 * combined into one String. Any extra characters from mismatched length String are at the end.
 *
 * Ex:
 * String one = abc
 * String two = defgh
 *
 * Output:
 * adbecfgh
 *
 * Ex:
 * String one = java
 * String two = is
 *
 * Output:
 * jiasva
