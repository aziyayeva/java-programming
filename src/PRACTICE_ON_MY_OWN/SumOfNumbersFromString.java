 * [Sum of Numbers from String]
 *
 * Create a method that will accept a String and returns the sum of all the numbers in the String.
 *
 * Requirement: any numbers that are next to each other are not single digit numbers but instead read as a full number
 * 	Ex: a5bc12def100g
 * 		Here we would have added 5 + 12 + 100
 * 		NOT: 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0
